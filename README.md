# The Player Folk Index

The Player Folk Index (PFI) is a new measure to track the social impact of football players and teams. 

PFI measures the popularity of players indexed against their on-field ability, as measured by transfer value. Players with a high PFI are more popular with fans than their on-field ability would indicate, thus cultivating a 'folk' status. Players with a low PFI are potentially missing out on a higher social media presence. Two key uses of the tool are to track clubs' (and leagues') online footprint, as well as giving teams' scouts more information when considering whether to bring in a new player.

In this repo, we have included the latest player data for the currently tracked leagues, an explanatory PDF, and the code behind a Shiny App for easily navigating the data.

For more information on the methodology and potential use cases for the tool, please see the explanatory PDF in this GitHub repo.
